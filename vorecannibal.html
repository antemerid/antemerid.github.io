    <div class="bio">
    Born and raised in the united states, vorecannibal brings to the table aggressive, loud and abraisive
                noise rap. Getting his start with mashup music, cannibal ventured into original compositions in 2015, and 
                has been tirelessly working on his debut mixtape, "Pills Like White Elephants" ever since. Cannibal's 
                bizarre and violent flow tears through noisey landscape after noisey landscape, featuring his own beats
                as well as beats crafted by the likes of Equinox7, JamKamme and Enterfant.
